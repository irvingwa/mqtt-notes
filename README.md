MQTT seems to work better than STOMP
MQTT is a lightweight, publish-subscribe network protocol that transports messages between devices. The protocol usually runs over TCP/IP, however any network protocol that provides ordered, lossless, bi-directional connections can support MQTT. It is designed for connections with remote locations where a resource constraints exist or the network bandwidth is limited. 

## notes
QOS can be applied to both a topic and messages.
